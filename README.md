3)chromadb. This is our vector Database. ChromaDB is easy to use and open source, maybe the most used Vector Database used to store embeddings.


#PromptTemplate: provide the functionality to create prompts with parameters.

#LLMChain: To create chains, where the prompts or the results can pass from one step to another inside the chain.
